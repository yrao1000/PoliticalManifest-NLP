## Detecting patterns from large datasets
### Clustering algorithms :
These algorithms are helpful for analysing large amount of unstructured data such as texts collected from different sources. Clusters can help identify differnt groups, post which each group can be analysed with differnt and more precise techniques according to use case

1. K-Means  _(used in the notebook)_ : Find the optimal centroids and then assigns data points to them
2. KNN : This algorithm only runs at test time, and assigns new data point to a particular class based on it nearest neighbours and the categories they belong to.
3. EM Clustering : This is a soft clustering algorithm, which means points can belong to more than 1 clusters simultaneously.
